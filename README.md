# Introduction_to_R

R is an interpreted programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/). It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. This page presents how to run R in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for better documentation, reproducibility and sharing the results. Python, Jupyter Notebook and R should be already installed.
